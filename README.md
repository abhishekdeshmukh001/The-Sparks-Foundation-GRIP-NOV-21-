The Sparks Foundation ( Data Science and Business Analytics Internship ) :- GRIP [ Graduate Rotational Internship Program]  - November-2021

# Tasks performed :- 

# TASK 1 :- Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning.
- In this task we have to predict the percentage of a student based on no. of study hours.
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables.
- Python language is used which is easy to understand and implement.
- Predict the score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

# TASK 2 :- Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning.
- From the given 'Iris Flower' dataset, we need to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
- This task is solved using K-Means Clustering Method.
- Python language is used whcih is easy to understand and implement.
